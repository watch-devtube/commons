We'll also cover the possibility of bringing Mapbox GLNative to other open source platforms, such as GTK. Lastly, we'll dive intoour recently collaboration with the Qt Company to bring the power andflexibility of Qt to Mapbox GL Native.\n\nMapbox GL Native is an open source, cross-platform framework for responsivemaps. It provides developers with highly detailed maps, sourced fromconstantly updated OpenStreetMap data, as well as complete design control overthe style and feel of their maps. This is all done using a new, open sourceon-device vector renderer, which uses OpenGL ES 2.0 technology for pixel-perfect map design. Everything from antialiased fonts to polygon blurring ishardware-accelerated and optimized for mobile devices â€” all on the fly.\n\nThis talk will explore how Mapbox GL Native, a hardware-accelerated maprendering engine, can bring beautiful maps made with open data to the opensource community.
