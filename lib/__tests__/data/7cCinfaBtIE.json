Second step is the\nintegration of the resulting equations.\nFor the first step we use the package sympy which is on a very\nadvanced level to perform symbolic calculation and which supports\nalready Lagrange's and Kane's formalism. The extensions we made are\nsuch that a complex mechanical setup can be formulated easily with\nseveral lines of python code. The functionality is analogous to well\nknown MBS-tools, with that you can assemble bodies, joints, forces and\nconstraints. Also external forces even in a cosimulation model can be\nadded on top. The second step, the integration is done via ode-\nintegrators implemented in scipy.\nFinally for visual validation the results are visualized with the\nvpython package and for further analytics with matplotlib.\n\nConclusion: not only highly constrained pendulums with many rods and\nsprings but also driving simulation of passenger cars an be performed\nwith our new extension using python packages off the shelf.","views":1256,"likes":11,"dislikes":0,"satisfaction":100,"comments":0,"creationDate":1530308517,"objectID":"7cCinfaBtIE"}
